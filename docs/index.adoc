= Sylt

Sylt is a statically checked and dynamically typed programming language made for
game jams. Working in Sylt should be a pain- and fearless experience. If it
isn't, please file an
https://github.com/sylt-lang/sylt-lang/issues/new/choose[issue].

This introduction talks about how to install Sylt and write your first program
and game. You may also want to check out the link:guide.html[Guide] and
link:quick-reference.html[Quick Reference].


== Installing the compiler

The simplest way of getting the binary is to download a tagged release from
https://github.com/sylt-lang/sylt-lang/releases/.

If you can't download a pre-built binary (due to a different architecture or
operating system) or don't want to, you will need a Rust installation and the
source code. We don't test older versions of Rust so try to get the latest
stable version.

If you don't have Rust installed, consider using https://rustup.rs/ and
selecting the latest stable version.

With Rust installed, run

[source, shell]
----
$ cargo install sylt --git https://github.com/sylt-lang/sylt-lang.git
----
to
install the latest and greatest from the main branch. If you want a tagged
version you can add `--tag <tag-name>` to the command, as in

[source, shell]
----
$ cargo install sylt --git https://github.com/sylt-lang/sylt-lang.git --tag v0.1.0
----

You can also download the source code and build it locally with

[source, shell]
----
$ cargo install --path sylt
----

== Writing a simple program

Put the following hello world-program into a file called `hello.sy`.

[source, sylt]
----
start :: fn do
    print("Hello world!")
end
----

Run the program by typing `sylt hello.sy` in a terminal!

[source, shell]
----
$ sylt hello.sy
Hello world!
----

Let's walk through what happens in this program.

[source, sylt]
----
start :: fn do           // <1>
    print' "Hello world" // <2>
end
----

<1> Define the program entry point.
<2> Greet the world.

Like `main` from languages like C and Java, a Sylt program requires an entry
point (`start`) to start in.

// more here? probably

== Writing a simple game

With the world greeting out of the way, we can get a simple game going.

// TODO: wait for l√∂ve
