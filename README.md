Sylt is a statically typed dynamic programming language that compiles to Lua.

For information about how to use the language and get started with writing games
in it, check out our language documentation at https://sylt.rs.

# What Makes Sylt Unique?

The short version:
 - Compiletime typechecking
 - Simplicity in the syntax
 - Fast recompiles
 - Fast iteration times
 - Integrated with LÃ–VE 2D

Sylt has very a different design mentality compared to systems programming languages like Rust or C++ - and strays far from enterprise software like Java or C#. Sylt is primarily focused on getting you to write the code you need, as fast as possible and then to iterate on it. Sylt is closer to APL in this mentality - where terseness is considered a feature - rapid iteration is the priority.

# Sylt and Game Jams
The language is made for game jams, and has been used in multiple. Unfortunately
the language has been rewritten multiple times between each jam, and since
there's no goal of making Sylt backwards compatible it means there are (currently) no
games made in the most recent verision of the language.
